Hello! I'm MuhammadÂ **Afrizal**, a passionate student majoring in Mathematics with a keen interest in programming. I have always been fascinated by the world of coding, and I've taken it upon myself to dive into the realm of self-taught programming. My educational journey began in a vocational high school where I specialized in software engineering, which laid a strong foundation for my programming skills.
